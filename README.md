## The-Butterfly-Hugs ESP32

<h3>
A Butterfly Hugs project using the ESP32 microcontroller focuses on creating a calming and therapeutic device for stress relief or emotional grounding. It utilizes the ESP32 to control small vibrating motors or actuators placed on both hands, simulating the comforting "butterfly hug" technique used in therapy. The ESP32’s versatility enables customization, such as adjustable vibration patterns, Bluetooth connectivity for mobile control, and real-time feedback. This project can serve as a helpful tool for emotional regulation, especially in mental health applications, while showcasing the ESP32’s capability in building wearable and wellness devices.
